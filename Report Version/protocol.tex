\section{Anonymous Protocol}\label{sec-protocol}

In this section, we propose a way to protect the identity of participants
of such computing model by using a novel(?) anonymous networking protocol.
The goal of the protocol is to remove the source information from the data
packet. We call this One-Way Protocol since the source information is
complectly removed, and the server is unable to reply any kind of
acknowledgement back to the client. The protocol will be implemented on
both the server and the client to achieve the anonymous effect.

What we would like is a protocol that completely removes the ownership and
source information from the data transmitted to the data collection server.
Figure 1 illustrates the concept of the theoretical anonymous One-Way
protocol.

We envision the protocol to be a network layer (layer 3) protocol that
replaces the IP protocol. The protocol will be very similar to the IP protocol
in the way that the packets includes the address of the destination host so
that the packets can be correct routed. The protocol should be able to
encapsulate upper layer (e.g. transport layer) data. The only difference is
that each packet does not include the address of the source host. In other
words, contractually, the client does not include the source address and the
server will have no access to the source information and thus keeping the
client's identity private.

Proponents might argue since the protocol resides on network layer (layer 3),
the source address could still be contained in the lower layer, e.g. the link
layer (layer 2). We argue that the source link address is different for
each hop on the route, and a route could easily contain 20 hops; therefore
the probability of tracing the link layer packet back to the original host is
really low.

\section{Anonymous Protocol Over Existing Protocols}\label{sec-protocol}
The One-Way protocol introduced in the previous section and Figure 1 is only
a theoretical protocol since it would take significant effort and drastic
change to current networking hardware infrastructure to introduce a new layer 3
routing protocol. In this section we modify the One-Way protocol depicted in
Figure 1 slightly so that it utilizes existing networking infrastructures. We
introduce two modifying approaches: tunneling and One-Way over User Datagram
Protocol (UDP).

\subsection{Tunneling}

In tunneling, the network topology is divided into two parts: a private
network that understands the One-Way protocol and the rest of the world that
only understand the IP protocol. The two parts are connected by the tunnel,
a special device, that does the translation between two routing protocols.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{figure2.eps}
\caption{\small \sl Tunneling.\label{fig:Stupendous}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{figure2b.eps}
\caption{\small \sl Tunneling.\label{fig:Stupendous}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure 2, the tunneling device takes packets from the One-Way
network and forward the
data to the IP network. An important task of the tunneling device is to attach
source IP address to the packets that being forwarded. The device uses it own
IP address as the address of the packets and shields the identity of the mobile
clients. A reason for this tunneling approach is that some internet service
providers (ISP) will block packets without valid source host address. Figure 3
depicts the networking stack configuration of this approach. Tunneling is
similar to the Tor Anonymouse Protocol ~\cite{Tor}, in which clients sends data
through the designated Tor servers and the servers are responsible to deliver
the data to the destination.

Opponent could argument that attacker can still trace the mobile clients to a
specific subnet where the tunneling device resides. We argue that since most of
the clients are highly mobile, and with a number of tunneling device in one
geographic region, the identity of the mobile devices can be protected with high
confidence.

\subsection{Over User Datagram Protocol}
In this approach, we completely do away with a new routing protocol by building
the One-Way protocol as an application layer protocol on top of User Datagram
Protocol (UDP).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{figure4.eps}
\caption{\small \sl One-Way over UDP.\label{fig:Stupendous}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure 4, during transmission, the clients divides the data
into one or more UDP data packets, uses arbitrary IP address as the source
address -- to protect the identity of the mobile clients -- and sends the
packet into the network. The reason we use UDP instead of TCP is that since
the source IP is arbitrary, TCP will be unable to
establish a connection with the handshaking protocol.

In this setup, both the server and the clients need to implement the UDP One-Way
Protocol. The server has to be aware and to be able to reconstruct the complete
data from the fragments. In the future version of this protocol, we plan to
implement a protocol that allows the clients to verify that the data, in full,
has been successfully transmitted to the server.

In addition to running the protocol with no intermediate nodes, we can also combine
the UDP One-Way approach with the tunneling approach. Similar to what we described
in the previous subsection, the tunnel is an intermediate node that does translation
of protocols. The advantage of tunneling is that we can translate from UDP to TCP
protocol to provide reliable transmission. To do this kind of translation, the
tunnel create TCP packet from UDP packet and uses its own IP address as the source
address. An advantage of this translation is that the server does not necessarily
have to implement the One-Way protocol.

\subsection{Summary}
In this section we proposed an anonymous protocol that completely remove the source
address information of the data being transmitted. Three way to realize this protocol
are completely new protocol, new protocol over tunneling, and anonymous protocol
over UDP.

In the completely new protocol, we assume that we have complete freedom to implement
a new protocol and new network infrastructure. This is a very unrealistic and
impractical assumption, so we proposed new protocol and tunneling. In tunneling
we can implement the new One-Way protocol in our own small network and the tunnel
is responsible bridging our internal network and public IP network. In the UDP
approach, we build our new protocol on top of existing IP network, therefore
no new network infrastructure is required.

%In our experiment, we are able to send IP packets with arbitrary source address into
%the network and receive it on the server.
