\section{Performance Evaluation}\label{sec-evaluation}

In this section we present our performance evaluation results.

\subsection{Transmission Overhead}

Transmission overhead is ratio between the amount of additional data that
is imposed by a protocol to the effective data transmitted. In our
measurements, transmission overhead include the headers of a protocol for
each packets as well as any replication of the data to peers. Let $D$ be
the original data captured by a mobile device to be sent to the server and
$D'$ be the total
