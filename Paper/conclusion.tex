\section{Conclusions}\label{sec-conc}

Due to the growth of the number and power of mobile phones, participatory
sensing is a new growing area in computer science. The potential of this
research is great

Due to being a new area, many issues are unaddress, including the identity
privacy of the participants. In this paper we presented an approach to privacy
protection by introducing One-Way anonymous protocol in which we remove
the source information of the data from the data transmitted to the server.

We first presented the protocol in the most theoretical form. The protocol
is a routing protocol that does not include the source host address. Since
The protocol cannot be realized with the existing networking infrastructure,
we introduced two modification to the protocol. The first modification is
to use a tunnel forward the packet from the One-Way network to the rest of
the Internet, where the server resides.

The second approach is to build the One-Way an application protocol on top
of UDP. In this approach we used arbitrary address as the source address to
conceal mobile client's identity.
